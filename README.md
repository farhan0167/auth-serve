# auth-serve

Auth Serve is a lightweight starter template for spinning up your own authentication and authorization server with OAuth2.0 baked in.

Let’s be real: nobody starts a new project excited about building an auth system. You just want to ship your SaaS idea or CRUD app, and suddenly you’re knee-deep in tokens, scopes, and role management.

Auth-Serve gives you a ready-made auth server with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) built in. Drop it into your stack, wire it up to your services, and you’re good to go. Less boilerplate, more building.

## Getting Started

1. Auth-serve uses `uv` package manager, so make sure you have it [installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
2. After cloning the repo, simply run `make server` and get started!
